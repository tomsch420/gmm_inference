# gmm_inference

This repository enables usable inference for Gaussian Mixture Models.
Currently the following are supported:

- Conditional GMMs, where they are conditioned on a vector.
- (Conditional) Probabilities over continuous sets.
- Most Probable Explanations (MPE) exactly iff conditioned on vectors and approximatly if conditioned on sets.
- Univariate Marginal (Posterior) Distributions conditioned on a Vector.
- Expectation and Variance conditioned on  a vector.
